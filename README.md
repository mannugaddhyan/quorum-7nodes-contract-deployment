# What does this contract do?

Contract Name: MyBank 

-- Allow users to deposit ethers to the smart contract address. 
-- Users can withdraw their ethers anytime they wish. The contract also rewards the users with ether( it is based on a simple interest formula, rate of interest is 18% per annum ).
-- We need to recharge the contract account before any user calls the withdraw function. ( it is beacuse there is no other way the contract account is earning. Haven't used the concept of lending users ether to earn interest yet ).
-- Any user can check their depoisted money. 
-- Can check the total money with the contract also.
